The command interpreter is similar to shell where I  can create, read update and destroy files based on the commands given and their interpratation
To start python provides a module cmd.py that supports a framework for writing line-oriented command interprators.
We pass this module to a file which we will use the file to open the command interprators framework after runing the file.
To use the command interprator, we need to provide it with the given commands used to run in the command interprator framework
examples of such kind of commands are help, update, destroy
